# HR Attrition Analytics — SQL & Power BI Project

## 👋 About This Project

This project explores employee attrition using SQL and Power BI with the goal of understanding **why employees leave** and what actions a company could take to improve retention.

I built the complete analytics pipeline myself — starting from raw HR data, cleaning and transforming it in SQL, designing a proper data model, calculating business KPIs, and finally creating an interactive executive dashboard in Power BI.

This project simulates the real workflow of a data analyst working with HR teams.

- Which departments have the highest employee turnover?
- Which job roles are most at risk?
- Does overtime significantly increase attrition?
- How does employee tenure impact attrition?
- Are there specific high-risk employee profiles?
