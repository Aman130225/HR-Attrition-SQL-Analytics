# HR Attrition Analytics — SQL & Power BI Project
## 🔎 Project Summary

This project analyzes employee attrition using a full analytics workflow:
data ingestion → transformation → dimensional modeling → KPI analysis → executive reporting.

It identifies the key drivers of employee turnover and provides actionable insights
to support HR decision-making and retention strategies.

## 👋 About This Project

This project explores employee attrition using SQL and Power BI with the goal of understanding **why employees leave** and what actions a company could take to improve retention.

I built the complete analytics pipeline myself — starting from raw HR data, cleaning and transforming it in SQL, designing a proper data model, calculating business KPIs, and finally creating an interactive executive dashboard in Power BI.

I wanted this project to reflect the real workflow of a data analyst supporting HR teams with data-driven decisions.

## 🧩 Business Problems I Wanted to Answer

- What is the overall employee attrition rate?
- Which departments have the highest employee turnover?
- Which job roles are most at risk?
- Does overtime significantly increase attrition?
- How does employee tenure impact attrition?
- Are there specific high-risk employee profiles?

## 🏗️ Data Pipeline Design

Each layer was designed deliberately so that business questions could be answered cleanly and reliably, similar to how data pipelines are structured in real analytics teams.

**Raw Data → Cleaning & Feature Engineering → Dimensional Modeling → KPI Analysis**

## 🚀 How to Run This Project (MySQL)

### 1) Create the database
Create a schema in MySQL called: `hr_attrition`

### 2) Run scripts in order (top → bottom)
1. **Load raw data:** [`sql/01_raw.sql`](sql/01_raw.sql)  
   > If using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`, update the CSV path inside the file to match your machine.
2. **Staging (cleaning + buckets):** [`sql/02_staging.sql`](sql/02_staging.sql)
3. **Dimensions:** [`sql/03_dimensions.sql`](sql/03_dimensions.sql)
4. **Fact table:** [`sql/04_fact.sql`](sql/04_fact.sql)
5. **KPI queries:** [`sql/05_kpis.sql`](sql/05_kpis.sql)
6. **Advanced insights:** [`sql/06_advanced_insights.sql`](sql/06_advanced_insights.sql)

### 3) Dataset
CSV is stored here: [`data/HR_Attrition.csv`](data/HR_Attrition.csv)

## 📊 Key Results
| Metric | Result |
|------|------:|
| Overall Attrition Rate | **16.12%** |
| Highest-Risk Department | **Sales (20.63%)** |
| Highest-Risk Job Role | **Sales Representative (39.76%)** |
| Attrition with Overtime | **30.53%** |
| Attrition without Overtime | **10.44%** |
| Highest-Risk Tenure Group | **0–1 years (34.88%)** |

## 💡 Business Impact

The analysis highlights critical areas for intervention:
- Improving working conditions for Sales teams could significantly reduce turnover.
- Reducing excessive overtime may lower attrition by more than 20 percentage points.
- Strengthening onboarding and mentorship for new hires can stabilize early-career retention.

These insights provide HR leaders with a data-driven foundation for strategic workforce planning.


## ✅ What These Results Suggest
- Attrition is concentrated in **Sales**, especially **Sales Representatives**.
- **Overtime** is a major risk factor (attrition is ~3x higher vs no overtime).
- The most vulnerable employees are **new hires (0–1 years)** → onboarding and early support likely matter a lot.
